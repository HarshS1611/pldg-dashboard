I setup the website repo locally and found nothing was wrong with the link rather the data(URL of the repo to be directed to) is fetched by an airtable table. We do this by using an Airtable API key. 
The issue lies in the URL that was being used earlier to call the getter function on this API integration is now upgraded and uses a new URL because of which I needed to change it. I needed some date format of the Airtable table because it is private and talked to Jarrod regarding the same in issue - https://github.com/jbarnes850/pldg-dashboard/issues/9.

Planning to finish it by the end of this weekend.

Following the recent maintainers' call, I developed and shared a documentation template designed to assist PLDG Cohort-2 members in drafting pull requests for libp2p.

Key Updates:
Template Creation: Created a pull request documentation template to improve clarity and professionalism while encouraging effective collaboration during maintainers' reviews.

Sharing with the Cohort: Shared the template with Cohort-2 members to standardize PR submissions, ensuring faster and more efficient reviews.
Documentation Link: The template can be accessed here: PR Documentation Template (please visit https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xWvDLAucFSC6DXI_2JriKmSSw9bTJGqlJjo01_Ejgg/edit?usp=sharing ) 

Next Steps:
Gather feedback on the template during upcoming maintainers’ calls.
Encourage adoption by new contributors to streamline the PR process for libp2p issues.

This initiative aims to foster collaboration, improve PR review efficiency, and support contributors in their work with the libp2p ecosystem.
",Adding QUIC module to py-libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/488,"This week, I made progress on my pull request for Py-libp2p by addressing feedback from Paul (@pacrob). After receiving his review and guidance, I identified the need to resolve linting issues and debug test errors in tests/core/transports/test_quic.py.

Action Plan and Progress:
-Executing make lint locally to address linting errors.
- Using pytest to debug and work through errors in the QUIC transport test file.
- Incorporating fixes and updates to the PR based on Paul's suggestions.

Next Steps:
- Finalize updates and push the fixes to the pull request.
- Notify Paul for a follow-up review.
- Continue collaborating with the maintainers to ensure the PR aligns with project standards.

Paul’s detailed feedback and support have been instrumental in improving the PR and aligning it with the team's expectations.

","4. Project/ Issue Name: BroadCast Loops

Link: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/issues/573

Describe your issue, PR or project: The pubsub.Tracer lacks a proper Close() method to handle cleanup, which can lead to resource leaks, such as dangling goroutines, when tracers are no longer needed.

Context:
Currently, there is no standard way to terminate a tracer gracefully.
Resource management issues can arise, particularly in long-running applications or during testing.

Proposed Solution:
Add a Close() method to pubsub.Tracer to handle resource cleanup properly.
Ensure that all running goroutines initiated by the tracer are closed upon calling this method.

Please find the proposed solution shared at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCXgjmlisPBKaIh8SEUiw9Bj9NEaqZ3mOgFlFqZcpCU/edit?usp=sharing

Impact:
Introducing a Close() method will improve resource management, prevent memory leaks, and ensure a cleaner shutdown process for tracers in libp2p-pubsub.

",10,"The PLDG programming has been instrumental in fostering collaboration and growth within the ecosystem. I greatly appreciate the structure and resources provided, which make it easier for participants to contribute meaningfully. However, I have a few suggestions to enhance the experience further:
Focused Onboarding for Cohort Members:
 While the current onboarding resources are helpful, a more structured onboarding session or workshop for new cohort members focused specifically on contributing to key ecosystems like libp2p would be beneficial. Many new contributors have expressed the need for clear guidance on where and how to start. 

Centralized Contribution Resources:
 It would be helpful to have a centralized repository of resources for new contributors, such as the PR documentation template I recently shared: please visit at https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xWvDLAucFSC6DXI_2JriKmSSw9bTJGqlJjo01_Ejgg/edit?tab=t.0 . This could include contribution guidelines, issue walkthroughs, and example projects to provide a smooth ramp-up.

Mentorship Opportunities:
 Creating formal mentorship programs where experienced members can guide newcomers would add tremendous value. Structured mentoring sessions could help contributors navigate challenges and align their contributions with project goals.

Encourage Cohort-Led Sessions:
 Encouraging experienced cohort members to host knowledge-sharing sessions can accelerate onboarding. I plan to host a session for new members on how to get started with libp2p and believe similar peer-led initiatives would enhance collaboration and learning.

Overall, the program is doing a fantastic job, and these suggestions aim to further streamline the contributor journey, ensuring all members feel supported and empowered.",,1/28/2025 2:57am

",List external ressources / tutorials on rust-libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/5717,"Weekly Project Summary
This week, I focused on integrating the chain-gossip example into the rust-libp2p repository, specifically addressing the issue outlined in #5717. The goal was to enhance documentation and improve the example's clarity for developers exploring decentralized gossip-based messaging.

Key Updates:
Refactoring & Documentation: Revised and improved the existing chain-gossip example to ensure better readability and usability. Documented key implementation details to help developers understand its functionality within libp2p.
Code Alignment with libp2p Standards: Reviewed and updated the example code to align with best practices in rust-libp2p, incorporating feedback from maintainers and existing implementations.
Discussion & Collaboration: Engaged with the maintainers to clarify aspects of the issue and align the approach with libp2p’s overall development direction.

Next Steps:
Gather feedback from maintainers and contributors on the revised example.
Implement suggested improvements and refine the documentation accordingly.
Explore additional enhancements to make the chain-gossip example more adaptable for real-world applications.
This work aims to streamline the developer experience by providing a well-documented and structured example, contributing to a more robust and accessible rust-libp2p ecosystem.

","4. Broadcast Loops: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/issues/573
Issue:
The pubsub.Tracer lacks a proper Close() method to handle cleanup, which can lead to resource leaks, such as dangling goroutines, when tracers are no longer needed.
Context:
Currently, there is no standard way to terminate a tracer gracefully.
Resource management issues can arise, particularly in long-running applications or during testing.
Proposed Solution:
Add a Close() method to pubsub.Tracer to handle resource cleanup properly.
Ensure that all running goroutines initiated by the tracer are closed upon calling this method.
Impact:
Introducing a Close() method will improve resource management, prevent memory leaks, and ensure a cleaner shutdown process for tracers in libp2p-pubsub.

5.  Project: js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private
Issue: Identify use-cases for WebRTC private-to-private communication
Progress and Actions Taken:
Drafted a list of use cases, including:
Decentralized Video Conferencing: Secure peer-to-peer video calls without intermediaries.
Gaming Networks: Real-time multiplayer gaming with direct player-to-player connections.
IoT Communication: Device-to-device communication without external servers.
File Sharing: Fast and private peer-to-peer file transfers.
Local Networks: Enabling communication in offline or limited-connectivity environments.
Analyzed requirements for these use cases, such as encryption, and scalability.
Next steps:
Finalize the list of use cases and prioritize based on feasibility and community interest.
Begin creating proof-of-concept demos for the most promising applications.
Impact:
This work aims to highlight WebRTC’s potential in decentralized systems and drive adoption within the libp2p ecosystem.

",10,"The PLDG Stewards have been doing an incredible job in fostering collaboration, streamlining onboarding, and providing valuable technical guidance. Jarrod’s session on leveraging AI tools for accelerating development and testing in core Filecoin projects was particularly insightful. It showcased how AI can complement developer workflows, enhance efficiency, and improve testing reliability—an area that is crucial for scaling PL projects. 

A few key aspects I really appreciate: 
- Structured Learning & Knowledge Sharing: Sessions like Jarrod’s make complex topics more accessible, equipping contributors with practical strategies to optimize their workflows. 
- Engagement & Responsiveness: The Stewards’ active involvement in discussions and feedback loops ensures that contributors get timely support. 
- Focus on Real-World Use Cases: The integration of AI into development and testing aligns well with industry trends and helps contributors stay ahead. 

Suggestions for further improvement: 
- More Hands-on Demos: Live coding sessions or guided walkthroughs could help reinforce AI-driven development strategies. 
- Resource Hub for AI Tools: A dedicated space with recommended AI-powered tools for PL projects could be beneficial. 
- Continued Focus on Practical Implementations: Encouraging contributors to experiment with AI-driven automation in their own workflows and share insights would further enrich the community. 

Overall, I appreciate the thoughtful approach to PLDG programming and look forward to more sessions like this.

The ipfs files cp command allowed importing non-UnixFS objects into MFS without validation, causing unintended behavior. Additionally, it lacked a --force flag for overriding constraints, unlike ipfs files rm.

Solution:
CID Validation:
* The root CID is now validated to ensure it’s a UnixFS node with supported codecs (raw or dag-pb). Errors are raised for invalid CIDs.

--force Flag:
* Added to ipfs files cp to allow bypassing validation, aligning it with ipfs files rm.

CLI and WebUI Updates:
* Validation and --force logic integrated into both interfaces.

Impact:
The fix prevents invalid imports into MFS, ensures consistency across commands, and enhances user control with the --force flag.",Add MFS Support to Reprovider Strategy,https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10704,"Problem:
The Reprovider.Strategy settings (roots and pinned) currently ignore content implicitly pinned via MFS. While pinned content is prioritized for announcements (#10376), MFS data is treated as cache and does not benefit from this prioritization.

Solution:
Enhance NewPinnedProvider:
* Extend it to walk through MFS in offline mode, skipping content not in the local repo. 
* Include locally cached CIDs of MFS ""entities.""

Respect onlyRoots Flag:
* When enabled, only yield root CIDs of directories and files (as defined in IPIP-402) during the MFS walk.

Impact:
This change ensures that MFS content is properly considered in reprovider strategies, aligning its treatment with pinned content and improving data availability in the IPFS network.",,,,,9,NOPE,,2/9/2025 4:04pm

My goal was to enhance the robustness of the p2p-listener component.

The motivation behind the PR was to proactively address a potential vulnerability. While exploring the code, I identified a direct type assertion within the stream handling logic that, if triggered with an invalid type, could lead to a runtime panic. I proposed adding a safe type check and nil check to prevent this possibility. The intention was to increase the overall stability and resilience of the ipfs/kubo codebase.
I interacted with @lidel during the code review process. @lidel raised a critical point: that the proposed change might mask an underlying problem if a panic were to occur, making debugging more difficult in the long run. He suggested that instead of silencing the error with the type check, we should focus on fixing the root cause that could lead to the invalid type assertion in the first place.
@lidel's feedback was instrumental in my decision to close the pull request. I realized that without a concrete reproduction case for the potential panic, or a clear understanding of why it would be acceptable to silently handle it, the proposed change could be detrimental to debugging efforts in the future. His comments highlighted the importance of addressing the fundamental issues rather than simply patching over potential symptoms. I agreed that it was best to close the PR and potentially revisit the area if a real panic scenario arose.
In summary, my interaction with @lidel on PR #10690 was a valuable learning experience. While my initial intention was to improve code safety, @lidel's feedback helped me recognize the importance of careful error handling and the potential downsides of masking underlying problems. The conversation ultimately led to a better understanding of the codebase and a more informed decision to close the pull request.",Yes,1,improve(p2p-listener): ensure safe type assertion in stream handling #10690,https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10690,"Replace direct type assertion with a safe type check and nil check

I’m also actively working on GossipSub, refining its implementation to enhance message propagation efficiency.

Additionally, I’ve been collaborating with Longfei on the onramp contracts project. We made key enhancements to improve functionality and ensure smoother integrations.

Finally, I shared feedback on Filecoin improvements with Irene and Molly from the Fil-Oz team. This discussion covered potential optimizations and areas for further development in the ecosystem.

I incorporated significant code changes and am currently working on integrating transport_manager.py into py-libp2p/network, which should be completed in the next few days.
Additionally, I’ve been implementing improved error handling and logging features to enhance connection management. These updates will provide better debugging insights and stability.
On the same note, I am adding a higher-level QuicProtocol class. While quic.py already implements QuicStream and QuicRawConnection, it lacks a QuicProtocol class to manage multiple QuicRawConnection instances. This new class will:
Provide a higher-level abstraction for handling peer discovery, connection management, and stream coordination.

Something or other got clarified in each meeting. ,Yes,Storacha,"I interacted with Jamie from the Storacha team to discuss the AI agent work we’ve been doing. Last week, we divided tasks for a project proposed by the Storacha team, which focuses on building a workflow for AI agents using Storacha.

The core idea is to enable Agent A to store data on Storacha, which can later be retrieved by Agent B to perform specific actions. A practical example is booking vacation tickets:

- Agent A collects user data and stores it on Storacha using Lit Protocol, which provides encryption for private data.
- Agent B retrieves the data from Storacha and seamlessly completes the booking process.

My role was to ensure that Lit and Storacha worked properly for encryption, decryption, and data storage. I was given access to a repository that the Storacha team has been working on. After reviewing the implementation, I tested each action and made a few minor adjustments. My fork of the repository can be found here: https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/lit-storacha-Agent/tree/lit-storacha-agent

During my discussion with Jamie, I provided updates on my progress. Afterward, I also met with another cohort member, Praneet, who is working with me to integrate Eliza into the system. Jamie helped us outline the next steps for Storacha and clarified how Eliza, which operates in TypeScript, can interact with Storacha’s Go and JavaScript implementations via an HTTP API bridge.

The session not only strengthened my understanding of the protocol but also led to my promotion as a libp2p maintainer (please visit https://github.com/libp2p/github-mgmt/pull/272 )

During these sessions, I had the opportunity to:
- Review key PRs and contribute to the core development of py-libp2p.
- Onboard new PLDG members, helping them navigate the libp2p ecosystem.
- Take on new maintainer tasks, including issue triaging, reviewing contributions, and aligning workstreams across the libp2p ecosystem.

Additionally, the js-libp2p maintainer calls were extremely helpful in understanding interoperability between js-libp2p and py-libp2p. These discussions highlighted key differences in implementations and helped me work towards improving cross-language compatibility.

We worked through some edge cases in cross-language compatibility and discussed improvements in protocol-level integrations. These interactions helped in bridging gaps between JavaScript and Python implementations of libp2p.

rust-libp2p: I also engaged with João from the rust-libp2p team, discussing optimizations in Rust’s libp2p stack. The focus was on performance improvements, aligning with efforts across the ecosystem.

AI Agents in Storacha
In addition to my libp2p contributions, I continued bootstrapping AI agents within Storacha, exploring decentralized coordination mechanisms using libp2p’s networking capabilities. This work is crucial in integrating autonomous agents with peer-to-peer architectures, leveraging libp2p for efficient message passing and decision-making.

Last week was highly productive, with contributions spanning code reviews, interoperability improvements, protocol optimizations, and AI agent integrations. My interactions with the py-libp2p, js-libp2p, and rust-libp2p teams helped solidify key architectural decisions while advancing libp2p’s ecosystem-wide development.
",Yes,4+,Add QUIC module to py-libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/488,"This week, I made significant strides in refining the QUIC module in py-libp2p, following feedback from @pacrob, @acul71, Sam, and Dave.

Key Updates & Code Contributions
- Merged core changes to integrate transport_manager.py into py-libp2p/network. This provides a structured approach for managing multiple transport protocols, ensuring better modularity and maintainability.
 -  Implemented improved error handling & logging for QUIC connections, reducing silent failures and enhancing debugging insights.

Code Contributions & Integration Updates
- Pushed multiple PRs for review addressing the above improvements.
- Improved packet loss handling & congestion control in the QUIC transport layer.
- Integrated code changes of Luca to the main branch.
",refactored host_interface in Py-libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/504,"This week, I worked closely with Paul and the py-libp2p developers to investigate and resolve key issues in the refactoring of host interfaces for py-libp2p. After in-depth discussions and debugging, we identified the root causes of the problems affecting the code commits. A fix is in progress and will be implemented soon.

The event was well-organized, and the discussions were highly valuable in fostering a deeper understanding of libp2p’s ecosystem and its ongoing developments.

As someone who was promoted to a libp2p maintainer in part because of my involvement with PLDG programming, I’d like to share some positive feedback along with a few suggestions for further enhancing the experience:

Positive Feedback
- The community engagement has been exceptional, particularly in encouraging collaboration across teams like py-libp2p, js-libp2p, and rust-libp2p. I have seen clear benefits from the opportunities to interact with maintainers and developers from different parts of the ecosystem.

- The well-structured events and focused discussions have allowed me to stay aligned with core project goals, whether it's about interoperability, performance optimizations, or the latest protocol developments.

- The mentorship and support from existing maintainers, facilitated by the Stewards, have been invaluable in navigating the transition to maintainer roles, enabling me to take on additional responsibilities with confidence.

Overall, I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities PLDG programming has provided, and I truly believe that the Stewards' leadership plays a central role in ensuring the success of these initiatives. I’m looking forward to continuing to contribute and see the community evolve with even more collaborative programming.",,2/17/2025 12:33pm

The Storacha calls explicitly shared resources for the next steps in our AI agent project on Storacha. Additionally, the Drand calls were helpful in identifying good first issues and explaining initial tasks to get started.",Yes,Storacha,"I interacted with Jamie from the Storacha team to update her on our progress with AI agents on Storacha and to ask her technical questions related to our implementation.

First, I provided her with updates on our work. As mentioned in last week's survey, we have been working on privately encrypting agent data using Lit Actions and storing it on Storacha. This week, I conducted a deep dive into MotherDAO’s architecture to understand how they integrate their SQLite database, Lit Actions, Collabland, and Eliza. The goal was to apply a similar architecture to our project.

From this analysis, I determined that we could (and are currently) build a chatbot connected with Eliza. The chatbot’s data will be privately encrypted using Lit Actions and stored on Storacha. Another AI agent will then retrieve this encrypted data and perform the required task. For example, if I provide the chatbot with my travel plans, the system will encrypt and store the information on Storacha using Lit, and another agent will process it accordingly.

This week, our focus has been on building the Eliza agent. I explained to Jamie the technical challenges we encountered during development and how we are currently debugging the issues.

In response, Jamie informed us about the HTTP Standard Bridge from Storacha, which could be useful for our implementation. Most of our discussion revolved around project updates.

Additionally, I compiled a document explaining MotherDAO’s architecture, as several contributors working on AI agents were struggling to understand it. You can view the document here: https://motley-popcorn-c4a.notion.site/Motherdao-1a02ab2404df8088a9a3f287d5c9cd0f

The issue was that Drand was unnecessarily performing BLS signature verification on partials from nodes that were not in the group file, leading to wasted computational resources. Instead of failing early, these invalid partials were only discarded after failing the expensive cryptographic verification process.

To address this, I created PR #1405 (https://github.com/drand/drand/pull/1405), which optimizes validation in ProcessPartialBeacon by reordering the steps:

1. Validate the round number.
2. Extract the node index from the signature.
3. Check if the node is in the group file (new early validation step).
4. Only then perform BLS signature verification.

This ensures invalid partials are discarded earlier, reducing wasted computation and improving beacon processing performance. The change directly addresses Issue #1178 by implementing a fail-fast mechanism. 🚀",AI Agent on Storacha with Encryption using Lit Actions.,https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/lit-storacha-Agent document:  https://motley-popcorn-c4a.notion.site/Motherdao-1a02ab2404df8088a9a3f287d5c9cd0f,"I worked on integrating AI agents with Storacha while ensuring private encryption using Lit Actions. The goal was to securely store agent data on Storacha and enable retrieval by other AI agents for processing.

This week, I analyzed MotherDAO’s architecture, focusing on how they integrate SQLite, Lit Actions, Collabland, and Eliza. Based on this, I structured our approach to build:

1. A Telegram chatbot connected with Eliza, encrypting user inputs with Lit Actions before storing them on Storacha.
2. Another AI agent that retrieves and processes this encrypted data.

Example: A user shares travel plans with the chatbot → the data is encrypted & stored → another AI agent retrieves it for processing.

Additionally, I compiled a document explaining MotherDAO’s architecture to help other contributors working on AI agents.

One of the main topics was tutorials and resources for libp2p, which I have been actively contributing to. The discussion provided clarity on how to improve documentation and onboarding for developers looking to work with libp2p. This aligns with my focus on making libp2p protocols more accessible to new contributors.

Another significant topic was my maintenance role in py-libp2p, which was formally recognized in  (please visit https://github.com/libp2p/github-mgmt/pull/272 ). We explored potential improvements for py-libp2p, including adding QUIC support as a next step. Additionally, I was added as a reviewer for the dotnet-libp2p module, marking a new area of contribution for me within the libp2p ecosystem.

I also shared key projects aimed at helping new cohort members engage with libp2p. We discussed various ways to introduce developers to libp2p's modular stack and how to improve first-time contributor experiences across different implementations. The session highlighted the importance of maintaining up-to-date examples and clear documentation.

Beyond libp2p, the session also covered Fil-Oz and go-libp2p, where we discussed recent updates and potential areas for collaboration. These discussions were valuable for understanding how different teams are approaching interoperability and protocol enhancements.

Additionally, I found the Storacha and drand calls particularly helpful, as I have been working on projects at the intersection of drand and Storacha. We discussed how randomness beacons like drand can be integrated into decentralized storage solutions and how these technologies can complement each other. The insights from these calls will directly inform my work in building more resilient and trustless systems using Filecoin and libp2p.

Overall, this session reinforced my commitment to libp2p development and provided clear next steps for my contributions across py-libp2p, rust-libp2p, dotnet-libp2p, and drand-Storacha integrations.

",Yes,"Drand,Fil-Oz,Libp2p,Storacha,Fil-B","Last week, I engaged with multiple teams across the libp2p ecosystem, focusing on py-libp2p, dotnet-libp2p, and js-libp2p, while also making progress on AI agents in Storacha and bootstrapping drand efforts.

py-libp2p
I had in-depth meetings with Dave and Paul from the py-libp2p team, reviewing pull requests and completing key maintainer tasks. This included triaging issues, ensuring alignment with the broader libp2p roadmap, and refining implementation details to improve stability and performance. These discussions were critical in maintaining momentum within the py-libp2p project.

dotnet-libp2p
I also engaged with Alexey from the dotnet-libp2p team, discussing optimizations in dotnet’s libp2p stack. The focus was on performance improvements and potential integration of universal connectivity dapp, aligning with efforts across the ecosystem.

js-libp2p
We had a detailed discussion with Alex from the js-libp2p team during the maintainer's call, diving deeper into interoperability between js-libp2p and py-libp2p. We worked through some edge cases in cross-language compatibility and discussed improvements in protocol-level integrations. These interactions helped in bridging gaps between JavaScript and Python implementations of libp2p.

AI Agents in Storacha
In addition to my libp2p contributions, I continued bootstrapping AI agents within Storacha, exploring decentralized coordination mechanisms using libp2p’s networking capabilities. This work is crucial in integrating autonomous agents with peer-to-peer architectures, leveraging libp2p for efficient message passing and decision-making.

Drand & Storacha Teams
I had productive discussions with members of the  drand and Storacha teams about projects at the intersection of decentralized randomness (drand) and storage integrity (Storacha). We explored how randomness beacons can strengthen decentralized proofs and trust models. These conversations have helped refine the architecture of my ongoing work in this space.

Last week was highly productive, with contributions spanning code reviews, interoperability improvements, protocol optimizations, and AI agent integrations. My interactions with the py-libp2p, js-libp2p, and dotnet-libp2p teams helped solidify key architectural decisions while advancing libp2p’s ecosystem-wide development.
",Yes,4+,Adding QUIC module to Py-libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/488/,"This week, I worked closely with Paul and the py-libp2p developers to investigate and resolve key issues in implementation of QUIC module for py-libp2p. After in-depth discussions and debugging, we identified the root causes of the problems affecting transport stability. A fix is in progress and will be implemented soon.

Key Progress & Contributions
 - Reviewed and discussed PR
- Shared feedback and error resolutions
- Shared timeline on merging the code commit

Milestones:
 - Debugging transport manager issues, improving peer connection handling and error resilience.
 - Addressed QUIC handshake inconsistencies, which were causing connection failures in certain network conditions.
- Strengthened logging and error reporting, making debugging and diagnostics more efficient.
 - Finalized the integration of QuicProtocol, which now enables multi-connection management, providing a seamless transport adapter for libp2p nodes.

This PR is an important step in making QUIC a first-class transport in libp2p. Once merged, it will significantly improve connection stability, peer discovery, and performance.
",Add agent version to identify protocol and improved tests,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/506,"I am contributing to the development of a pull request for the Identify Protocol feature in py-libp2p. One of the key issues I addressed was that the returned agent Version field was previously set to a generic ""py-libp2p/unknown"", which did not provide meaningful information about the node.

To resolve this, I guided Luca to:
- Add a function in libp2p/utils.py to dynamically return the correct agent version.
- Modify libp2p/identity/identify/protocol.py to include this function, ensuring that the correct agent Version is now returned in the Identify response.
- Improve the test coverage in tests/core/identity/identify/test_protocol.py by adding verification for every field in the Identify response.

Next Steps:
We are planning to complete #358, which involves adding the missing observed address from the stream and then implementing identify/push.
This will bring the implementation closer to compliance with the Identify Protocol specifications.

This work enhances the accuracy and interoperability of the Identify Protocol in py-libp2p, improving how peers exchange metadata in the network.

Now, we're feeding this value from the user's config directly, and if there's none, we fallback to a default again.

This refactor also allows users to log in to multiple (bluesky/PDS) accounts at a time. Originally, the accounts list wasn't updated whenever we login, now, the handle and decentralized identifier of a user are stored together in the config, so it is easier to logout of an account.

Retrieving posts from the PDS was futile at first because the collection value was harcoded.

BackupManager collocates all the supposed actions of the CLI, allowing people to backup their posts in one swoop with bb backup posts

The command fetches posts available in the PDS, saves them locally, and offers to back them up on Storacha. If people happen to back up their posts and end up not uploading to Storacha immediately, they can still do it anytime with this command: bb backup upload

This commit also introduces an update to the PdsManager command group that was formerly `test`. Now it is admin since we basically use it to carry out admin operations (create posts, list posts, signup etc) on the PDS.",,,,,10,,,3/1/2025 4:48pm

We also discussed the next steps for video content creation for libp2p. Dave inquired if we were interested in recording videos for libp2p, which led to further brainstorming.",Yes,2,lit-storacha-agents,Project: https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/lit-storacha-agents/tree/main/agents/eliza-starter ,"Over the past few weeks, I have been working on integrating Lit, Storacha, and AI agents into our project. The goal is to build an AI-driven chatbot that encrypts user data with Lit Actions and securely stores it on Storacha. Another AI agent can then retrieve and process this encrypted data for various purposes. For example, if a user shares their travel plans with the chatbot, the system encrypts and stores the information on Storacha using Lit, and a separate agent can later retrieve the data to book tickets or perform other tasks.

This week, I focused on building Eliza, a witty and sarcastic vacation-planning AI agent. I started by defining its character, lore, bio, topic models, and example interactions, ensuring that it could engage users in a humorous yet useful manner. The complete character.json used to train Eliza can be found here:
https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/lit-storacha-agents/blob/main/agents/eliza-starter/characters/eliza.character.json

Eliza is designed to act as a roasting travel planner, collecting and remembering user preferences while maintaining a humorous and slightly sarcastic tone. The idea is to make travel planning both entertaining and efficient, ensuring that users not only get the best travel suggestions but also enjoy the interaction.

To bring Eliza to life, I set up a Telegram bot named sassport bot and connected it to the Eliza agent, allowing users to chat with it seamlessly. I also worked on refining the GitHub repository, adding proper installation instructions and removing redundant code from the Eliza starter kit to improve usability for other contributors. For model integration, I used OpenRouter, which helped optimize the chatbot’s responses and made the interaction smoother.

To showcase Eliza in action, I created a video demo where my roasting travel planner AI agent critiques my trip to Bali in a sarcastic yet helpful way. You can watch the demo here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wrWYDLOBLztOlbL-XpfM37VnCNvr1_o6/view

This integration is a step toward building fully encrypted, AI-powered agents that can securely store, retrieve, and process sensitive data for real-world applications. Looking forward to further refining and expanding this project! 
This week work can be found here: https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/lit-storacha-agents/tree/main/agents/eliza-starter ",fix discrepancies in tier names on storacha.network website,issue: https://github.com/storacha/storacha.network/issues/42 PR:https://github.com/storacha/storacha.network/pull/126,"This PR standardizes tier names across the website to maintain consistency. Previously, the pricing page used ""Mild, Medium, Spicy,"" at multiple places while Stripe, SLA, and docs etc. referred to them as ""Starter, Lite, Business."" This mismatch could cause confusion for users.

To resolve this, I updated all instances to follow the ""Starter, Lite, Business"" naming convention, ensuring uniformity across the platform.

Each of these calls provided valuable insights, but I found the Libp2p Maintainers Call to be the most informative. 

During this session, I learned how seemingly simple issues can escalate into critical problems if not addressed promptly. For instance, we discussed the importance of keeping dependencies and versions up to date, as outdated libraries can introduce security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. We also delved into the significance of proper rendering techniques and how they can impact performance and user experience.

Additionally, the call highlighted best practices for code reviews and the importance of thorough testing in preventing regressions.

Overall, these discussions reinforced the need for proactive maintenance and continuous learning within the community.",Yes,"Fil-Oz,Fil-B","During my contributions to projects such as Lighthouse, Bellperson, Lassie, and fvm-wasm-instrument, I had the opportunity to interact with several key individuals from our Tech Partners.

One notable interaction involved reaching out to a developer from one of the Tech Partner organizations regarding a specific issue I encountered while integrating a new feature in the Lighthouse project. The problem revolved around a complex dependency that was causing build failures, and I needed guidance on how to resolve it effectively.

In our discussion, the developer provided valuable insights into the underlying architecture of the project and shared best practices for managing dependencies. They also directed me to relevant documentation and resources that clarified the integration process. Additionally, they offered to review my code changes and provide feedback, which was incredibly helpful in ensuring that my contributions aligned with the project's standards.

This interaction not only helped me overcome the immediate technical challenge but also deepened my understanding of the project's ecosystem.

This document outlines the project's objectives, setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines, facilitating a smoother onboarding process for peers looking to engage with the project.

During my navigation through the codebase, I also identified several instances of unused, unnecessary, and duplicate code. To enhance the overall quality and maintainability of the project, I undertook a systematic code cleanup, removing redundant code and organizing the structure for improved readability.

The hasDNSLinkRecord function now explicitly checks if the provided hostname is an IP address. If it is an IP address, the function immediately returns false, skipping the DNSLink lookup.

This change avoids unnecessary DNS queries when the hostname is an IP address. This improves efficiency and reduces potential delays, especially in local development environments where DNS lookups for IPs are not needed and can sometimes cause issues.

Libp2p Community Call
 The libp2p community call provided valuable insights into ongoing development efforts and future roadmaps across different language implementations (Go, Rust, JS, and Python). The discussion around QUIC and WebTransport stood out, particularly the comparison between Go’s quic-go and Zig's QUIC module. The feedback on improving peer management and optimizing the get_peerstore method was also very relevant to my work on py-libp2p. Additionally, hearing updates from other maintainers about challenges with interoperability and future goals for protocol negotiation made it clear how much progress is being made across the ecosystem.


Storacha AI Agents Call
 The Storacha AI agents call was impactful because it demonstrated real-world use cases where AI agents are integrated with decentralized storage solutions. The presentation on Eth ElderEase using Storacha for AI-powered senior care was especially compelling. The combination of secure data storage, quick retrieval, and AI-driven decision-making highlighted Storacha’s strength as a foundation for building intelligent, data-driven dApps. The brainstorming session on improving retrieval speeds and optimizing indexing strategies was very engaging — it’s clear that Storacha has the potential to play a pivotal role in AI-enhanced decentralized applications.


Both sessions reinforced the importance of secure, scalable, and efficient communication in decentralized systems. The libp2p session focused more on foundational improvements at the protocol level, while the Storacha session highlighted practical implementations and real-world impact — a powerful combination of theory and practice! 
",Yes,"IPFS,Libp2p,Storacha,Fil-B,Fil-Oz","I've had productive and insightful interactions with both the libp2p and Storacha teams, particularly with Dave and Paul from py-libp2p and Jamie and other senior devs from the AI agents team at Storacha.

Libp2p (py-libp2p) Interactions

I’ve been working closely with Dave and Paul, who are key contributors and maintainers of py-libp2p.
- We discussed several maintainer-level tasks, including improving the handling of peer management and evaluating the need to replace the async_service module with a simpler, more maintainable solution like anyio.
- Dave provided valuable insights on managing long-running services and improving structured task handling, which helped refine the architecture of py-libp2p’s connection lifecycle management.
- Paul assisted with debugging an issue related to get_peerstore and peer connection status tracking. His deep understanding of libp2p’s internal routing and protocol negotiation helped resolve inconsistencies in peer discovery and connection state updates.

Their guidance has been instrumental in strengthening py-libp2p's core functionality, especially around transport protocol support (QUIC, WebRTC) and improving compatibility with Go and JS implementations.

Storacha (AI Agents) Interactions
With the Storacha team led by Jamie, I collaborated on integrating AI agents with decentralized storage.
- I participated in a demo where the team showcased their AI agents project using Storacha for knowledge retrieval and real-time decision-making.
- The discussion focused on optimizing indexing strategies and improving retrieval speed for large data sets stored on Storacha.
- The demo on Eth ElderEase, which leverages AI agents for senior care using Storacha for secure storage and quick data retrieval, was shared with the team.
- The Storacha team’s insights on improving search accuracy and enhancing the agent’s ability to adapt to new data sources were very helpful for refining the overall architecture of the project.

Both interactions have significantly improved my understanding of decentralized storage and connectivity challenges, and I’m looking forward to continuing to collaborate with these teams to enhance the performance and scalability of both py-libp2p and Storacha-based AI solutions. 
",Yes,4+,Pubsub example for py-libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/515,"This pull request adds a comprehensive PubSub example for py-libp2p, demonstrating the implementation of a secure and scalable publish-subscribe (PubSub) messaging system using GossipSub.
Summary of Changes:
New Example Code
Created a fully functional example showing how to set up and use GossipSub in py-libp2p.
The example includes both the publisher and subscriber logic, handling message publishing, subscription, and peer discovery.

Peer Management
Configured peer discovery using the get_peerstore() method to establish connections dynamically.
Implemented connection status tracking to manage live peers and handle reconnections.

Message Handling
Developed structured message encoding and decoding.
Added error-handling logic to ensure smooth message delivery and prevent duplicate messages.

Testing and Debugging
Verified successful message propagation between peers.
Handled edge cases where peers drop out or reconnect during message exchange.

Guidance and Collaboration:
Guided Sumanjeet through the entire implementation process, from setting up the peer connection to handling message flow and subscription updates.
Provided detailed feedback on improving message encoding efficiency and peer discovery reliability.
Coordinated with other py-libp2p maintainers to ensure compatibility with existing transport protocols (e.g., QUIC, WebRTC).

Impact:
✅ Demonstrates how to build real-time, decentralized messaging using GossipSub in py-libp2p.
 ✅ Serves as a reference for developers looking to integrate PubSub functionality into their py-libp2p projects.
 ✅ Enhances py-libp2p documentation by adding a practical example, improving onboarding for new contributors.
This example strengthens the py-libp2p codebase and aligns with broader libp2p goals of improving real-time peer-to-peer communication. 
",Assess the need for replacing async_service,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/pull/525,"I reviewed and provided detailed feedback on the proposal by @paschal533 to replace async_service with anyio in py-libp2p. The proposal is well-structured and thoughtfully addresses key issues around maintainability, compatibility, and performance.

✅ Strengths Identified
Thorough Analysis: The proposal correctly identifies async_service's role in structured concurrency, task cancellation, and error handling.
Clear Recommendation: anyio is a modern, well-maintained library that supports both asyncio and trio backends — a solid long-term choice.
Compatibility Preservation: Preserving the existing API surface reduces migration friction for downstream projects.
Simplification: Code size reduction from ~1000 to ~400 lines improves maintainability and reduces the bug surface.

⚠️ Concerns and Recommendations
Dependency Impact:
anyio introduces a new abstraction over asyncio and trio — compatibility with other asyncio-based libraries needs validation.
Suggested creating a compatibility matrix to confirm seamless integration with existing py-libp2p dependencies.

Performance Considerations:
Recommended running performance benchmarks to measure task scheduling, cancellation, and load-handling efficiency.
Early tests suggest comparable performance, but load-handling differences should be validated.

Backward Compatibility:
Confirmed that existing async_service-based test cases passed without modification.
Suggested testing deeper internal behaviors like error handling and task lifecycle under stress conditions.

Maintenance and Ecosystem Fit:
anyio’s long-term stability looks promising, but monitoring for future breaking changes is essential.
Recommended maintaining a phased rollout with feature flags for a smoother transition.

Testing and Migration Strategy:
Proposed expanding test coverage to validate lifecycle, concurrency, and error-handling scenarios.
Suggested introducing gradual migration to minimize disruption for downstream projects.

🚀 Tasks Completed:
✅ Reviewed the proposal and confirmed alignment with libp2p’s long-term roadmap.
 ✅ Suggested compatibility matrix to evaluate anyio alongside other asyncio-based dependencies.
 ✅ Recommended expanding test coverage for lifecycle, concurrency, and error handling.
 ✅ Provided strategic input on a phased rollout to minimize friction during migration.

🌟 Impact:
This contribution strengthens py-libp2p’s core architecture, improving long-term maintainability and performance. The switch to anyio sets a solid foundation for future scalability and ecosystem alignment.

I implemented HTTP caching headers (ETag and Last-Modified) across multiple endpoints, including document version listings, node listings, and search results, by introducing a CacheControlMixin to standardize cache control headers. This change significantly reduces server load and bandwidth usage by enabling the server to return a lightweight 304 Not Modified response when data remains unchanged, and I conducted thorough testing to ensure functionality. Additionally, I updated the Profile model to include regex-based validation for social media URLs (telegram_url, twitter_url, bluesky_url) by implementing the clean() method, ensuring that only valid URLs are stored and providing immediate feedback on incorrect formats. I also optimized memory usage in the parseErrorsToHashes() function by pre-allocating the exact size needed for slices, minimizing unnecessary growth operations. Furthermore, I addressed clarity issues by fixing typos in error messages within sdk.go and created a comprehensive README.md file to provide beginner-friendly documentation.

",Yes,"Drand,Fil-B,IPFS,Libp2p,Storacha","I’ve had the opportunity to engage with several individuals from the libp2p and Filecoin Builders teams as part of my ongoing contributions to the ecosystem.

Core Team Members I Interacted With:
- Dave, Joao and Paul Robinson (libp2p team): Shared insights during calls related to py-libp2p development, particularly around Identify, Peer store, Pub-sub example, universal connectivity dapp, WebRTC and QUIC integrations.

- Jamie and Alan: Both provided valuable guidance on the Storacha AI Agents Toolkit, specifically on resolving an issue with the progress toolbar.

- Longfei (Filecoin Builders): Assisted with early stages of the OnRamp Contract project and helped clarify documentation improvements.


Discussions and Support:

py-libp2p Development:
- In discussions with Dave, we explored key challenges in integrating QUIC using AIOQUIC, MsQuic, and the NAPI Rust library. His technical insights on QUIC’s architecture and implementation steps were instrumental in advancing this feature.

- Dave also reviewed and provided feedback on ongoing work for Gossipsub upgrades and Peerstore handling, ensuring alignment with the broader libp2p roadmap.


Storacha AI Agents Toolkit:
Jamie and Alan provided detailed feedback and actionable solutions for troubleshooting the progress toolbar, which helped me identify and begin resolving a critical issue. Their suggestions also guided me on best practices for improving the toolkit’s user interface.


OnRamp Contracts (Filecoin Builders):
Longfei’s guidance during the initial phases was critical in overcoming deployment issues. She also directed me to documentation and tools that expedited my progress, enabling me to contribute effectively to GitHub issues.

How They Helped:
- Technical Clarity: Each interaction deepened my understanding of the protocols and provided clear next steps for implementation or debugging.

- Actionable Feedback: I received detailed, actionable advice that directly improved the quality and efficiency of my work.

5. Storacha AI Agents Update: Please visit https://github.com/orgs/storacha/discussions/62     ",10,"Firstly, I’d like to commend the PLDG Stewards for their exceptional efforts in fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment. The programming has been impactful, and the level of support for projects like libp2p and Filecoin Builders is truly commendable. That said, I have a few suggestions to further enhance the onboarding and engagement process for cohort-3 members:

1. Skills-Based Onboarding Framework
To better align new members with project requirements, consider creating a detailed onboarding framework that highlights:

Core Technical Skills: For libp2p, familiarity with networking protocols, async programming (e.g., asyncio, anyio), and transport mechanisms like QUIC and WebRTC is crucial. For Filecoin Builders, knowledge of smart contracts (EVM or FEVM), IPLD, and decentralized storage mechanisms is key.
Recommended Tools/Frameworks: Share curated resources or tutorials to help members quickly get up to speed with essential tools like go-libp2p, js-libp2p, or the Helia CLI.

Community Contribution Guide: A streamlined guide for contributing to GitHub issues, submitting PRs, and engaging with maintainers will reduce friction for new members.

2. Cohort-Wide Mentorship Program
- Establish a mentorship program where experienced contributors guide new cohort members. For instance:
- Pair them with maintainers from libp2p or Filecoin Builders for their first set of tasks.
- Host bi-weekly office hours with stewards to address challenges and ensure alignment with project goals.

3. Project Spotlight Sessions
- During onboarding, organize interactive sessions highlighting key projects within PLDG. Examples:
- A deep dive into the Storacha AI Agents Toolkit to understand its potential in decentralized AI solutions.
- A walkthrough of key libp2p features like Gossipsub and Universal Connectivity Dapps to inspire contributions.

4. Recognition and Feedback Loop
- Recognition: Celebrate contributions via a “Contributor of the Month” initiative or shoutouts in community calls. This can motivate new members to stay engaged.
- Feedback: Implement regular feedback loops where new cohort members can share challenges and suggestions to improve the onboarding experience in real time.

5. Dedicated Onboarding for Specific Roles
- Tailor the onboarding process for different roles within the ecosystem. For example:
- Developers: Focus on GitHub workflows, coding standards, and testing.
- Researchers: Share documentation on protocol design and provide access to ongoing discussions about architectural decisions.
- Community Builders: Provide guidance on outreach strategies, event planning, and creating engagement around PLDG projects.

1. Lit Encryption & Data Storage

- We needed to decide whether to encrypt data before uploading.

- If we did, we'd have to keep using SQLite3 to store conversational history locally so Agent A could learn from users' past preferences.

- We also mapped out the workflow for both keeping and removing SQLite3 and what changes we'd need to make to AgentRuntime if we switched databases.

2. User Search Data Extraction

- We talked about what kind of data we should pull from user searches to improve trip planning.

- Right now, we're focusing on flights, hotels, and attractions as a proof of concept but were open to other useful data points.

3. Finding an Alternative API for Train Data

- Since SerpAPI doesn’t support train data, we needed a solid alternative.

- Most APIs we found were country-specific, but we were hoping to find one that covers multiple regions in one place.

Cleared all our bottlenecks by giving us solid answers to these questions. Their input helped us refine our approach and move forward with clearer decisions.

,seetadev,,"Week 11: March 24, 2025 (Monday) – March 30, 2025 (Sunday)",Weekly Standup,3 - Highly engaged,"I found the Libp2p Community and Maintainers' Calls particularly insightful, as they provided a deep dive into ongoing developments, key challenges, and upcoming features within the libp2p ecosystem. These sessions were valuable not just for understanding the technical roadmap but also for engaging directly with maintainers and contributors, which helped in aligning my contributions with community needs.

A special highlight for me was seeing PyLibp2p being appreciated in the Libp2p newsletter. It was great to see recognition for the work being done in the ecosystem and how different language implementations contribute to the broader vision of libp2p. Please visit https://blog.libp2p.io/newsletters/2025/03/ 

Additionally, the Storacha Community Calls stood out as they offered a great platform to discuss decentralized storage challenges and innovations. The discussions around storage security, data retrieval optimizations, and potential integrations with libp2p and Filecoin were particularly exciting. These calls reinforced the importance of robust decentralized infrastructure and how different projects within the ecosystem can interconnect to improve scalability and efficiency.",Yes,"IPFS,Libp2p,Storacha,Fil-B,Drand","Over the past week, I had the opportunity to engage with multiple teams across the libp2p ecosystem, focusing on py-libp2p, nim-libp2p, and rust-libp2p, while also making meaningful progress on AI agents in Storacha. These interactions were highly productive and reinforced the collaborative nature of the ecosystem.

- py-libp2p:
I worked closely with Dave and Paul from the py-libp2p team, reviewing pull requests and tackling key maintainer tasks. Our discussions covered issue triaging, roadmap alignment, and refining implementation details to improve overall stability and performance. Their guidance was instrumental in ensuring that py-libp2p stays in sync with the broader libp2p development efforts. This exchange of ideas not only helped drive critical updates but also enhanced my understanding of the long-term vision for py-libp2p.

- nim-libp2p:
I was involved in Gossipsub 1.4 discussions, specifically focusing on its roadmap for large message handling. These discussions were key in understanding the performance trade-offs and implementation strategies required to scale message propagation efficiently. Collaborating on this with the team gave me deeper insights into how different libp2p implementations handle pubsub at scale.

- rust-libp2p:
I also engaged with João from the rust-libp2p team, where we explored optimizations within Rust’s libp2p stack. João’s insights were particularly valuable in navigating the design choices necessary for improving transport efficiency and interoperability.

- AI Agents in Storacha:
Beyond my work on libp2p, I continued bootstrapping AI agents within Storacha, focusing on decentralized coordination mechanisms powered by libp2p’s networking capabilities. This effort is crucial for integrating autonomous agents with peer-to-peer architectures, leveraging libp2p for efficient message passing and decision-making. The ability to use libp2p as a foundation for AI-driven decentralized networks presents exciting possibilities, and I look forward to further refining this approach.

Overall Impact:
These engagements reinforced the collaborative and forward-thinking nature of the libp2p ecosystem. The support and technical discussions with maintainers across different implementations helped drive meaningful progress in multiple areas. I truly appreciate the opportunity to work alongside such knowledgeable and supportive peers, and I’m excited to continue contributing to these initiatives.

",10,"I truly appreciate the dedication and effort the PLDG Stewards put into making this program a valuable experience for all of us. The structured approach, combined with the flexibility to explore projects aligned with our interests, has been incredibly beneficial.

One aspect I particularly appreciate is the openness to feedback and collaboration. The Stewards have done an excellent job fostering a supportive environment where we can discuss challenges, seek guidance, and iterate on our work. For Cohort-3 and beyond, a few suggestions to further enhance the experience:

More cross-cohort collaboration – It would be great to have more structured opportunities to learn from previous cohorts, perhaps through recorded knowledge-sharing sessions or informal roundtables.

Hands-on workshops – While the async learning and discussions are great, interactive workshops or pair-programming sessions with Stewards and maintainers could help deepen technical skills.

Showcasing progress – Encouraging more community-wide demos where participants can share their work with a broader audience within Protocol Labs and the ecosystem could boost engagement and visibility.

Expanding project diversity – Highlighting a wider variety of projects in different domains, such as decentralized identity, governance, and new cryptographic primitives, could provide even more opportunities for exploration.

During our collaboration, we discovered a need for testing an older implementation's timeout behavior. I added this missing test to prevent future regressions.
We collaborated through conflict resolution, rebasing, and several review iterations until PR #124 was successfully merged. This PR implemented robust timeout handling in fetchCAR, introducing a max fetch duration timeout to abort long-running CAR retrievals.
I renamed internal timeout variables for clarity (requestIdleTimeout and maxDurationTimeout) and consolidated timeout flags based on Julian's feedback. The test I added simulates a long-running stream to verify timeout functionality.
These changes improved the code's resilience by ensuring safe abort in idle and extended duration scenarios, enhanced readability through clearer naming conventions. They expanded test coverage to catch potential regressions in timeout handling.",Yes,1,feat: add client-side max request duration timeout to Spark ,https://github.com/CheckerNetwork/spark-checker/pull/124,"Implemented timeout handling for CAR retrievals, improved naming clarity, and added a regression test.",,,,,,,,10,N/A,,3/31/2025 11:51pm

These sessions were valuable not only for understanding the technical roadmap but also for engaging directly with maintainers and aligning contributions with community needs. A highlight for me was seeing PyLibp2p recognized in the libp2p newsletter, which reinforced the importance of diverse language implementations. The Storacha Community Calls were also impactful, providing a space to explore decentralized storage challenges, innovations, and potential integrations with libp2p and Filecoin. I especially appreciated the focus on storage security and retrieval optimizations.

The Virtual Libp2p Day recordings were another highlight—especially Juan’s talk, which offered a compelling vision for the future of decentralized networking. I also appreciated the encouragement from Molly and Mosh, which really underscored the welcoming and supportive culture of the community. The panel discussions and thoughtful questions raised by fellow developers added great depth and perspective to the sessions. Altogether, these experiences significantly deepened my understanding of libp2p’s evolution and showcased the power of open, collaborative innovation. Huge thanks to the organizers, maintainers, and everyone involved for making this such a valuable experience.
",Yes,"Fil-Oz,IPFS,Libp2p,Storacha","Over the past week, I had the chance to collaborate with teams across py-libp2p, IPFS, nim-libp2p, and Fil-oz, while also advancing work on AI agents in Storacha with the guidance from Alan and Jamie. Working with Dave and Paul on py-libp2p helped align maintainer tasks with the broader roadmap, and I appreciated their thoughtful guidance on issue triaging and implementation improvements. The Gossipsub 1.4 roadmap discussions with the nim-libp2p team gave me deeper insights into scaling message propagation, and engaging with Michelle Mosh from IPFS provided useful perspectives on Py-libp2p developer on-boarding and engagement. 

I also continued developing AI agents in Storacha, focusing on decentralized coordination using libp2p’s capabilities. These efforts highlight the power of libp2p for building peer-to-peer autonomous systems. Additionally, the Virtual Libp2p Day sessions were a major highlight—Juan’s keynote offered a clear vision for libp2p’s future, and the encouragement from Molly and Mosh, along with thoughtful questions and panels from community developers, made the experience both energizing and deeply informative. Altogether, it’s been an incredibly rewarding and collaborative week in the ecosystem. We also launched utility token on Filecoin Mainnet at Sushiswap and are looking forward to building a community.

What the expected public key format is (compressed/uncompressed G2)

If there's a known-good verifier setup for Quicknet rounds

It was energizing and motivating, especially as we wrapped up the cohort.",Yes,Space Meridian ,"1)I contributed to improving the resilience of the SPARK checker in the Space Meridian project (issue #49) by making the system recover faster after network outages. I collaborated directly with @bajtos from the Space Meridian team. He provided review feedback on structuring delay logic more cleanly.
Changes Made:
Updated the Spark.run() loop to dynamically adjust the delay between retrieval tasks based on online/offline status.
Introduced a shorter retry delay (OFFLINE_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 5000ms) when the node is offline to improve responsiveness.
Utilized internal ActivityState tracking (.isHealthy()) to switch between fast recovery and normal pacing.
Logged online/offline state transitions with clear console messages.
Exposed isHealthy() in ActivityState class to support decision logic in Spark.
Added unit test to ensure OFFLINE_RETRY_DELAY_MS is applied correctly when offline.

Benefits of the Changes
Faster reconnection: Spark now retries every 5 seconds instead of waiting 60 seconds when coming back online.
Improved UX: Users no longer have to restart the Station app manually after waking from sleep.
Cleaner logging: Clear console messages indicate the recovery state.
Test coverage: The change is backed by a dedicated test ensuring delay logic is correct.
No behavior change when online: Normal task pacing remains unaffected for healthy connections.

2)I collaborated with Bajtos from the Space Meridian team on improvements to the Spark Stats project and continued my work on the Optimize DB schema and query for Top-Earning Leaderboard. We discussed how to consistently apply the mapParticipantsToIds helper across test files to improve code maintainability and avoid hardcoded participant IDs. Bajtos provided detailed code review feedback and made a few helpful cleanups himself (e.g., commit 2475264).
 I addressed the suggestions and refactored the test files accordingly while keeping certain helpers separate for clarity. His guidance helped streamline the test logic and align it with best practices.

3) Continue working on the issue. Verify randomness returned by drand REST API #86 within Spark Checker
I reviewed the drand-client integration used in the Spark Checker repo and explored public CDN options that support ESM-compatible delivery for Zinnia (like jsDelivr and esm.sh). I also analyzed a historical conversation from the DRAND team on Slack about issues with CDN bundling and verification being disabled in production.
As a next step, I drafted a message to ask the DRAND maintainers on Slack for clarification on the public key format used in tests and whether their test keys are compressed or uncompressed. This coordination is essential to completing the verification work.
The work on verifying randomness is still local for now, as I want to ensure the solution is fully working before submitting a PR.",Yes,3,Recover faster after network outage #49,https://github.com/CheckerNetwork/spark-checker/issues/49,Improve SPARK recovery speed after network outages.,Optimize DB Schema & Query for Top-Earning Leaderboard #340,https://github.com/CheckerNetwork/spark-stats/pull/340,Refactored the test files according to the feedback while keeping certain helpers separate for clarity,Verify randomness returned by drand REST API #86,https://github.com/CheckerNetwork/spark-checker/issues/86,Explored public CDN options that support ESM-compatible delivery for Zinnia (like jsDelivr and esm.sh).,,10,The structure and support have been fantastic.

,seetadev,,"Week 13: April 7, 2025 (Monday) - April 13, 2025 (Sunday)",Weekly Standup,3 - Highly engaged,"The libp2p community call was incredibly informative, especially the sessions on transport modularization and the evolution of connection handling. The clarity around upcoming changes—like better abstraction between transports and stream multiplexers—was impactful, especially as we're actively thinking about modular transport stacks in our work. Hearing how different teams are addressing latency, resource efficiency, and NAT traversal gave me both strategic context and actionable ideas. It’s exciting to see libp2p heading toward a more composable and adaptive architecture.

The Storacha call was equally insightful. The Storacha team’s approach to unifying decentralized messaging with structured storage opens up new possibilities for lightweight, local-first apps that still sync globally. It also raised interesting questions about routing optimizations and content addressing strategies that we’re keen to explore further.

Overall, both calls reinforced how vibrant and forward-looking the ecosystem is. Grateful to be part of it and looking forward to more collaboration.
",Yes,"Libp2p,IPFS,Fil-B,Storacha","This past week was a deeply collaborative and rewarding one across the libp2p and IPFS ecosystems. I had the opportunity to present libp2p updates, progress, and roadmap at the Engres event organized by the Fil-oz team leads, which sparked valuable discussions around future directions and cross-team alignment.

I also worked closely with Dave and Paul from the py-libp2p team to align maintainer tasks with the broader roadmap. Their guidance on issue triaging and implementation improvements was incredibly helpful in refining the project's direction and contributor experience.

In discussions with the nim-libp2p team, I gained deeper insights into scaling message propagation through the Gossipsub 1.4 roadmap, and appreciated their openness in coordinating protocol evolution across implementations.

On the Storacha side, I advanced work on AI agents that use libp2p for decentralized coordination—showcasing libp2p’s potential in powering autonomous, peer-to-peer systems.

Altogether, these interactions—combined with the positive feedback received from Virtual Libp2p Day—made this week incredibly impactful and energizing.

They highlighted the community's focus on improving performance and compatibility.

Key areas of concern include type safety, where I noted instances of using Any that could lead to runtime errors and proposed specific type annotations for timestamps, CIDs, and interfaces. Additionally, I highlighted deficiencies in error handling, particularly within the ConnectionPool class, where gRPC connections are established without timeout configurations, suggesting the implementation of robust error logging and handling strategies. I also raised concerns about the lack of configurable timeout parameters for gRPC connections, which can result in indefinite hangs during network issues, and proposed a design for allowing users to specify timeout settings. Through these in-depth analyses, I aim to facilitate community discussions and contribute to the ongoing enhancement of the SDK, ultimately leading to a more robust and user-friendly library for developers.",Yes,2,Improve Type Annotations for Better IDE Support and Type Safety ,https://github.com/akave-ai/akavesdk-py/issues/30,"Improve type safety in Akave SDK by replacing Any with specific types for timestamps, CIDs, and interfaces.",Improve Error Handling in Connection Management - Timeout Configuration Missing,https://github.com/akave-ai/akavesdk-py/issues/31,Enhance Akave SDK by adding timeout configurations for gRPC connections to prevent indefinite hangs during network issue,,,,,10,"I want to take a moment to recognize the fantastic work done by Anuba, Cores James, and our other tech partners.

One small piece of feedback: I had an issue with the impact rating for week 8/9. The team and tech partners mentioned it would be looked into and a sync would be scheduled—I’d really appreciate it if that could be resolved. I believe the work I put in during those weeks was deserving of a 5 rather than a 4. If that’s not the case, I’d genuinely appreciate feedback on where I can improve.",,4/14/2025 4:09pm
