0x215a58eEF2ae37478C461ca44B9329F261484a9c,Weeks 8-9: March 3-16,"This contributor is doing awesome work in leading development of a FIP to implement EIP-2537 in the Filecoin FEVM. We currently have an almost final code PR and FIP draft, pending completion of a few final tests and upating the FIP draft to reflect these tests"
0x215a58eEF2ae37478C461ca44B9329F261484a9c,Week 10: March 17-23,"Continued to make strong contributions toward the BLS12-381 precompile FIP. Led the drafting and review of the proposal, incorporated feedback from implementation discussions, and flagged a key bug in field element encoding. Steady and high-quality progress."
0x215a58eEF2ae37478C461ca44B9329F261484a9c,Week 11: March 24-30,Maintained momentum on the BLS12-381 FIP work despite a missed sync because I was OoO. Continued progress on implementation and documentation has been consistent and impactful.
0x158B1ff33cdb34768AeD6C8BF0461e875c738dAf,Weeks 8-9: March 3-16,"Giving a generous 3 here, assuming good intentions. One PR was successfully merged (albeit generously), but the other two raise some concerns.
The first hasn't seen any follow-up or further engagement, and the third felt like a potential AI-generated drive-by — it didn’t come across as a legitimate or thoughtful contribution.
There’s a clear need for more active engagement and collaboration with project contributors and maintainers."
0x20d862012233aFEF7105d29D79fbf2215B3FecAa,Week 10: March 17-23,"Excellent work on this and collaborating with Alex on it. Thank you! Please note, you received a 5 because multiple issues were resolved over this time though there is a link directly to the repo versus individual issues; that is OK to link out to repo only."
0x20d862012233aFEF7105d29D79fbf2215B3FecAa,Week 11: March 24-30,"Thanks for optimizing this and continuing to work closely with the team.

Please note, you received a 5 because this single issue/PR has had multiple revisions; we appreciate your presistence and openess to feedback."
0x295aBEf9F9252163E29E542945361c587dF4ca06,Weeks 8-9: March 3-16,"Made a useful contribution, though it required some additional work to fully address the issue. The PR didn’t get a follow-up from the contributor after feedback was provided — though to be fair, the reviewer may have jumped in a bit quickly to make the necessary changes themselves.
It’s a good reminder that contributing to OSS isn’t just about submitting code — staying engaged and responsive is key. Otherwise, someone else may step in and finish the work."
0x295aBEf9F9252163E29E542945361c587dF4ca06,Week 10: March 17-23,"This is a good example of needing to build more consensus around the work that you're proposing to contribute, and additionally engaging around it. These two things are further signals that the contribution is legitimate, and that if the maintainers spend time to engage on this work, it won't be a waste of their time."
0x295aBEf9F9252163E29E542945361c587dF4ca06,Week 11: March 24-30,"The issue was addressed clearly, and the few pieces of feedback provided were quickly resolved. The changes were then accepted and merged smoothly. Thanks for the contribution!"

This PR also has a high impact score as it migrates one of our most critical pieces of infrastructure to new, more maintainable stack. It's still far from being finished but once it lands I think it's going to make a difference."
0xEc9b3E9641350A6e626A51468E4030e2d72c286D,Week 10: March 17-23,Looks like this PR for Fastify in Checker is close to completion but has a few issues and comments remaing.

0xD579fd9D7f879002CB5Cea4D8D766d2561809993,Weeks 8-9: March 3-16,This PR includes a change to make somewhat high impact as it's should optimise performance of statistical queries related to station earnings. Hany has dug deep into query execution in order to figure out how they could improve the performance with some help from the team. Hany has done good job given that they had little to no context about this codebase or queries.
0xD579fd9D7f879002CB5Cea4D8D766d2561809993,Week 10: March 17-23,One out of the two PRs has been merged and this is one important backend services. The feedback and comments on the PRs is very positive from the team. Great work Hany
0xD579fd9D7f879002CB5Cea4D8D766d2561809993,Week 11: March 24-30,This work was more at the protocol level than some of the other submissions which is great to see. It shows that Hany is having to reason about how the Spark protocol works and some of the issues it may face. This work is of medium impact too

He shows up to all of the meetings and has been a key part of coordination between other PLDG members and project contributors. Manu's involvement in py-libp2p earned him a spot as maintainer. I hope he continues to be part of the libp2p project long after his time in the PLDG cohort.
0x8dc640a257DE18857F8d24e1Ae2645F8bBa1E034,Week 10: March 17-23,Manu is a fantastic leader in the libp2p community.

Unfortunately, both of these PRs are still open, with no engagement from a contributor on the project—which is a crucial factor to always watch for.
They have been engaging with other users on the related issues, which is a positive sign, even if it’s not the primary goal. So I’m willing to assume good intentions here.
The builds appear to be passing (though that's somewhat superficial and may be misleading).
Giving a 3 for effort for now."

This demonstrates bad faith—why open the PRs if there’s no genuine intent to address the problems?
In each case, the changes were largely superficial (e.g., whitespace from a linter or formatter), with almost no meaningful code added.
In the few places where new code was introduced, it either didn’t work or failed to address the underlying issues.
Given all of this, I am rating this as 0."

The engagement after we've wasted time reviewing said junk has also been quite bad, so unless something drastically changes there, further submissions will not be looked at from this candidate. If they aren't willing to even understand the project and code base, they are only doing harm."

However since starting their efforts, they haven't reengaged again to get feedback on their work. That's something that needs to happen, make sure you're on the right path, that both sides haven't made any assumptions, and get buy-in for your work getting integrated/merged later. This might turn into a higher rating in a subsequent week when/if this works eventually lands."
